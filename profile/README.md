|----|--------------------------------------------------------|
  
  
Developed since 2006, [GAMA](https://gama-platform.org) is an easy-to-use open source modeling and simulation environment for creating spatially explicit agent-based simulations. The generic nature of the approach advocated by GAMA allows its thousands of users to use it in a number of application domains and for a wide variety of purposes: scientific simulation, scenario exploration and visualization, negotiation support, serious games, mediation or communication tools, the possibilities are endless!

This organization brings together the main repositories used to develop, build, test and use GAMA:

- **[gama](https://github.com/gama-platform/new.gama)**: contains the Eclipse projects for the development of the platform. A documentation on how to build these versions from source is available [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/new.gama/wiki/InstallingGitVersion). Serves as a hub for raising [issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/new.gama/issues) about using GAMA. **New features, additions or main evolutions to the plaform will be occuring here**
- **[gama.experimental](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.experimental)**: contains extensions to GAMA considered as "experimental" (i.e. not shipped with the release versions). Plugins present in this repository are automically built against the latest version of GAMA. 
- **[gama.clients](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.client)**: dedicated to the development of GAMA clients (in json, python, etc.) and the GAMA Server API
- **[gama-platform.github.io](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io)**: contains the sources of [GAMA's website](https://gama-platform.org) and serves as a hub for raising [issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io/issues) about GAMA's website and documentation. 
- **[gama.resources](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.resources)**: contains various resources and archived resources used in GAMA (icons, logos, splash screens...) or around it (conferences material, documentation...)
- **[gama old repository](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.old)**: contains the Eclipse projects used to maintain the platform in its 1.9.x version. A documentation on how to build these versions from source is available [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/InstallingGitVersion). Serves as a hub for raising [issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues) about using GAMA 1.x. **No features will be added in the future to this branch, which will primarily serve for making sure GAMA 1.9.x remains usable**

## How to contribute to GAMA
#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds a new feature?**
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch if you think your addition is worth being included in the relevant repository: for the [maintainance of 1.9.x](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/pulls) or for [adding new features](https://github.com/gama-platform/new.gama/pulls). If this contribution concerns the documentation, the GAMA Server clients, or experimental features, head to their respective repositories.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution or the new addition. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one in the platform?**
* Suggest your change in the [gama-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gama-dev) or in the [discussion section of GAMA](https://github.com/gama-platform/new.gama/discussions).
* Do not open an issue until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for support.

## Support

#### **Do you think you found a bug in GAMA ?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub in [GAMA 1.x issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues) or [GAMA issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/new.gama/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one in the corresponding repository. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Templates are provided to help you contribute.

#### **Do you have questions about your models?**

* Ask any question about how to use GAMA in the [gama-platform mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gama-platform).
* Discuss potential evolutions, enhancements, changes in the [discussion section of GAMA 2](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama2/discussions)
* Consult the documentation on the [website](http://gama-platform.org).
