|----|--------------------------------------------------------|
  
  
Developed since 2006, GAMA is an easy-to-use open source modeling and simulation environment for creating spatially explicit agent-based simulations. The generic nature of the approach advocated by GAMA allows its thousands of users to use it in a number of application domains and for a wide variety of purposes: scientific simulation, scenario exploration and visualization, negotiation support, serious games, mediation or communication tools, the possibilities are endless!



This organization brings together the main repositories for developing, building, testing and using GAMA:

- **[gama](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama)**: contains the Eclipse projects used to build the platform in its current 1.x version. A documentation on how to build GAMA from source is available [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/InstallingGitVersion). Serves as a hub for raising [issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues) about using GAMA.
- **[gama2](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama2)**: contains the Eclipse projects for the development of the version 2 of the platform. Largely experimental for the moment, this version will reinforce the modular aspect of the platform.
- **[gama.experimental](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.experimental)**: contains extensions to GAMA considered as "experimental" (i.e. not shipped with the release versions). Plugins present in this repository are automically built against the latest version of GAMA. 
- **[gama.clients](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.client)**: dedicated to the development of GAMA clients (in json, python, etc.) and the GAMA Server API
- **[gama-platform.github.io](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io)**: contains the sources of [GAMA's website](https://gama-platform.org) and serves as a hub for raising [issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io/issues) about GAMA's website and documentation. 
- **[gama.resources](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.resources)**: contains various resources and archived resources used in GAMA (icons, logos, splash screens...) or around it (conferences material, documentation...)

## Support

#### **Do you think you found a bug in GAMA ?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub in [GAMA 1.x issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues) or [GAMA 2.x issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama2/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one in the corresponding repository. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Do you have questions about your models?**

* Ask any question about how to use GAMA in the [gama-platform mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gama-platform).
* Discuss potential evolutions, enhancements, changes in the [discussion section of GAMA 2](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama2/discussions)
* Consult the documentation on the [website](http://gama-platform.org).
