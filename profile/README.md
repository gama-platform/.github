## Welcome to the GAMA Platform organization on GitHub

Developed since 2006, GAMA is an easy-to-use open source modeling and simulation environment for creating spatially explicit agent-based simulations. The generic nature of the approach advocated by GAMA allows its thousands of users to use it in a number of application domains and for a wide variety of purposes: scientific simulation, scenario exploration and visualization, negotiation support, serious games, mediation or communication tools, the possibilities are endless!



This organization brings together the main repositories for developing, building, testing and using GAMA:

- [gama](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama): contains the Eclipse plugins used to build the platform in its current 1.x version
- [gama2](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama2): contains the Eclipse plugins for the development of the version 2 of the platform
- [gama.experimental](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.experimental): contains extensions to GAMA considered as "experimental" (i.e. not shipped with the release versions)
- [gama.clients](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.client): dedicated to the development of different GAMA clients (in json, python, etc.) and the corresponding GAMA Server API
- [gama-platform.github.io](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io): contains the sources of [GAMA's website](https://gama-platform.org) and serves as a hub for raising issues about GAMA's documentation. 
- [gama.resources](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.resources): contains various resources for GAMA (icons, logos, splash screens...)
